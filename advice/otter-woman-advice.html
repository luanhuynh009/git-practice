                <h4>Go easy on yourself &hellip; but not <strong>TOO</strong> easy</h4>
                <p> Yes, learning to code is hard.  But if you constantly tell yourself this, it can lead to giving yourself a break.  And you need to keep at it!
                     Of course, get up and walk around the block,  stretch,  play with your fuzzy companion,  but then <em>get back in front of that computer,  focus,  and bend 
                        your mind to this stuff.</em>  It'll get easier with consistent thinking and practicing.</p>
                <h4>Drink water, get plenty of good rest, and stock your fridge with healthy foods</h4>
                <p>Brain fog definitely won't help you learn programming faster.  Neither will being tired or hungry.  Don't forget to take care of yourself 
                     so <em>your</em> machine functions are all running smoothly.
                </p>
                <h4>Have fun!</h4>
                <p>If you're getting into this in an attempt to pivot careers or gain the know-how to establish a lucrative side hustle,  don't look at it 
                    as the work you need to do to get the work.  Try thinking of it as a challenging game that will give you insight to greater satisfaction.
                    And after putting some solid time in, do what really makes you happy,  tick,  feel alive,  <strong>be you.</strong>
