            <h1>Hi, my name is Suzanne and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>
 
        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Drink enough tea</h4>
                <p>Make sure you drink enough tea while you're coding. If you drink tea, you get enough liquid which makes it easier to think</p>
 
                <h4>Get up for a hoop dance</h4>
                <p>Put a timer for 27 minutes. After 27 minutes put a timer for three minutes, get up, grab your hoop and have a nice hoop dance. 
                    (If you don't have a hoop, do the same without a hoop.)</p>
                <p> Moving around is good for three reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It will prevent back pain from sitting down too long.</li>
                    <li>It is better for your eyes to regularly look away from the screen. Make sure during those three minutes you don't look 
                        at any screens!</li>
                    <li>After moving around it is easier to focus again.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Go for a walk</h4>
                <p>Go for a walk before your work, during your lunch or after your working day. Or (bonus points!) all three.</p>
                <p>It has the same advantages as hoop dance, with the added bonus of some nice fresh air.</p>

                <h4>Healthy seat</h4>
                <p>Find a seat that works well for you and that enables you to sit up straight. This prevents back pain. You could try a standing desk, 
                    a treadmill desk, a rocking knee chair, a stool, a balance ball, or even better: after each hoop dance pick another way to sit/stand!</p>
                
                <h4>Eat cake</h4>
                <p>Most important: don't forget to eat some cake when you have finished a project! This advice doesn't need any explanation of course.</p>
