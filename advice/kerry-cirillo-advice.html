            <h1>Hi, my name is Kerry and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>If it was <span>easy</span>, there wouldn't be a need for these skills!</h4>
                <p>The store Staples had a marketing campaign, the message was to press the 'easy' button.  Well I don't want to 
                    discourage you but there isn't an 'easy' button in learning something like coding and front end development. 
                    If it were easy to learn these skills there wouldn't be a demand in the marketplace and the pay wouldn't 
                    be above average. There are some topics that will make sense when they are explained, when that happens, 
                    shout and do a happy dance. Honestly, there will be far more topics that will leave you scratching your head and 
                    doubting yourself.  </p>

                <p> Most humans want what comes easy. You and I aren't like that. We will push ourselves instead of looking for 
                    that 'easy' button in life. Because 'easy' is not rewarding and we want more than that for our lives! .</p>

                <h4>Know the freedom you want to keep <span>motivated</span>.</h4>
                <p>Learning anything new is daunting. When you take this daunting skill, put it in a self-paced course and work 
                    from home with a thousand distractions you are going to need a lot of motivation. What motivates one person 
                    may mean nothing to the next. You have to find what matters to you. Common to all of us is there 
                    is a certain freedom we will gain from our new skills. It may be to get out of toxic job, have a better quality 
                     of life, less financial stress, the ability to work from home or something very unique. Get ahold of what freedom you will gain and
                     you can stay motivated on the toughest days. Make certain you have a clear picture of what this freedom looks 
                     like for you. Imposter Syndrome, getting stuck and many other things can really zap your motivation, take a break
                     and focus on the freedom you desire, it helps you tap back into the inner motivation. </p>

                <p>Besides knowing what freedom you are after, there are ways to keep  excited about the field of technology.  
                    I listen to podcasts and read blogs that excite me about the possibilities. There is so much out there for new coders!  
                    On my office my white board it shows how many hours I have studied. Also, motivational quotes that keep things in 
                    perspective and awards and successes from other areas of my life. Of course some pictures that keep me focused on 
                    my freedom are included on my white board.</p>

                <h4>Learn how to <span>learn.</span></h4>
                <p>This statement may not have been top of mind when you started this new venture but it is important. You want your 
                    time spent studying to be as effective as possible.  Thinking about the enviornment you are in is a simple start,
                    do you learn better with music on or a quiet place? What about the time of day? Or the place you study. Does 
                    writing notes help solidiify a concept, what about repetition or talking about things as you learn. How we learn is an 
                    entire field of study. Not sure how to learn better, listen to some podcasts or read a few articles to gain some 
                    tips. Just don't deceive yourself into believing that learning is easy.</p>
                <p>A few things that have helped my learning. Accepting that mastery does not happen in the learning process.
                     Being slow and steady is way more effective than trying to push through the lessons. If I did an exercise but 
                     don't 'get it' at all then I will repeat the exercise to see if it will make a little more sense. When I have 
                     repeated an exercise 2 or more times without success, I print out the instructions. This paper in hand gives me 
                     the ability to check every word of the instructions. Missing one word of instruction is a lot. When I am stuck 
                     I explain the problem out loud and often hear the solution. Sometimes I go back a lesson or 2 to see if the 
                     concepts fit together better. The easiest mistakes is also where you should look when things don't work.  
                     Syntax, spelling and folder structure is unforgiving and so easy to mess up. Yes I said something was easy!/p>
