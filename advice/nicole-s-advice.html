                <h4>Don't get discouraged!</h4>
                <p>It can be so easy to feel like you're just never going to get it when first starting out. Trust in the process - it will happen for you with enough practice. Keep a "Growth Mindset." You can truly learn anything with enough time, effort, energy, and practice.</p>
 
 
                <h4>Do a little each day!</h4>
                <p>Just like learning a second or third language, it's helpful if you do a little bit each day as opposed to doing large chunks but then nothing for days. Make coding a part of your daily routine, and over time you'll get further than you ever even expected.</p>
