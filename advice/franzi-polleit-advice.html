                <h4>Take it one step at a time!</h4>
                <p>When you start the journey of learning programming skills, you're probably not sure about where this will lead you.
                You might have a dream, but you don't know if you can actually achieve it or if you're even good enough for it.</p>

                <p>Rather than spending your time worrying about whether everything will work out, just take it one step at a time.
                Be patient with yourself. Seek help if you need it. And trust, that you will end up where you're supposed to be.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
