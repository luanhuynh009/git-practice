                <h4>Don't be afraid of making mistakes!</h4>

                <p>You ever heard the saying "fail fast, fail often"?? This is one of my favourite anecdotes to say aloud to myself when I'm struggling to learn a fresh topic. It reminds me that I shouldn't be afraid to fail, because failing and then overcoming it will help me to gain a deeper understanding of what I'm learning.</p>

                <p>Let's be honest - this isn't exactly straightforward stuff, these programs are complex and they require you to learn new languages in order ot interact with them. It might not all come at once, but it <strong>will</strong> come eventually! Don't lose faith, keep yourself on track and embrace mistakes.</p>

                <h4>Kick that imposter syndrome to the curb!</h4>

                <p>Imposter syndrome can be really difficult to silence, be kind to yourself and be sure to check in with how you're feeling after each lesson.</p>

                <p>Remember that everyone -- and I mean <strong>E V E R Y O N E</strong> -- feels like an imposter sometimes. Just remember that you're a boss, and you will overcome this!</p>

                <p>Don't forget to congratulate yourself for all the small wins each day, write them all on different colored paper and fill a clear jar on your desk. Any time you feel down in the dumps you can look at that jar and remind yourself of the dozens of victories you achieve daily! Proof that you're no imposter!</p>
