                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Take a Break!</h4>
                <p>This process of learning a new skill can be overwhelming at times and you might feel the urge to try to get everything done as quickly as possible. Maybe you have set a deadline for yourself and you feel like there's not enough hours in the day to get everything done and the pressure of it all is weighing you down. Stop, take a breath...maybe two.</p>
                  <p> Allow your mind to wander for a bit. Take a break from that problem at hand and come back with a fresh attitude to crush it. Just as much you need to exercise body and mind, rest is equally as important.  </p>
