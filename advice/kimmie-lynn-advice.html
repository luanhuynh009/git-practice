                <h4>Do things on your time!</h4>
                <p>Everyone learns differently, what might be easy for you could be hard for someone else and vice versa so give yourself time and space to learn.</p>

                <h4>Don't doubt yourself</h4>
                <p>It can be easy to be crticial of how you are doing but just trying something new is something to celebrate.
