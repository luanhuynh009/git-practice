                <h4>A language is a language is a language</h4>
                <p>Learning any new language can be confusing and frustrating at first, and coding is no different. Although it's not a spoken language, it is a written one that has syntax and 'grammar' rules to follow. Learning new tags is just the same as learning new vocabulary. Nobody learns a new language overnight, and nobody becomes adept, let alone fluent, at it before spending many, many hours, weeks and months of hard practice. </p>

                <h4>Immerse yourself</h4>
                <p>It is a well known fact that the quickest way to learn a new language is through immersion. People who surround themselves with the language are more likely to become comfortable speaking it within a much shorter time than those that don't. When you set asside time to study and work on projects, try to set a block of a few hours rather than 20 minutes here and there. It will help to ingrain the new 'grammar' and 'vocabulary' in your brain far quicker.</p>

                <h4>Being lost soon becomes home!</h4>
                <p>The first time you delve into HTML and CSS, you will feel lost. Working with a text editor, and seeing all those indented lines, can be confusing at first, as is the language itself. Get used to that feeling of confusion and bewilderment. It will become easier and more natural, but when you move onto the next stage of your studies, those feeling come rushing back and where once you felt lost will now feel like home.</p>

                <p>When you move on to work with command lines and Git in Terminal, for example, going back into Atom amd seeing all those indents and tag will feel like going home!</p>

                <p>Don't get discouraged by any of this. It's all a natural part of the process of learning. Embrace it, enjoy it, revel in the fact that you know more today than you did yesterday.</p>
