                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>I had to redo my first website multiple times, and that is OKAY! What I learned is every time I would
                   get super confused, I would figure it out eventually. These times made me feel more confident in the
                   long run. </p>

                <p>Remember that you are learning an entire new language. Not sure about you, but when I tried to learn Spanish
                   I was never successful. Give yourself grace. You will be confused a lot, most days even! But with confusion
                   comes a lot of problem solving skills! Something we all need in this career field. </p>

                <h4>Lean on people!</h4>
                <p>The slack community is AMAZING! I think it's important to attempt to get on slack daily. Answer questions,
                   rework your own code, and then ask more questions. Do not be afraid to use slack. It is your friend. </p>

                <p>Reach out to the TA's. I was so nervous to ask too many questions, or even worse, a dumb question! I have
                   been met with continuous support.</p>

                <p>Hug your kiddos, loved ones, partner tight every day! If it weren't for the support of my loved ones who knows
                   where I would be. Sometimes when I think I am not good enough to change my entire career path, I look at my tiny
                   human and push forward. Believe in yourself. YOU GOT THIS!</p>
