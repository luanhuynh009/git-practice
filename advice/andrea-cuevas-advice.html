                <h4>Be kind to yourself!</h4>
                <p>Learning a new language or acquiring a new skill is always a challenge and sometimes we can be hard on ourselves for struggling with some of it. Take it easy, everyone has different
                abilities and can absorb information at different rates.  </p>

                <p>This doesn't mean you're more or less qualified to do this job and you need take it one day at time! Life can get it the way...and that's ok! Just remember
                you deserve to work in a field that allows you the freedom and flexibility you're looking for, even if it takes you a little longer :)</p>

                <h4>Setting SMART goals</h4>
                <p>Get motivated by setting SMART goals that are aligned with your current life situation. If you're working full time, make sure you set a manageable daily time goal to get
                your studies and practice done, without overworking yourself to the point you're commpletely depleted. </p>

                <p>Having goals will allow you to plan your time ahead of time and take the necessary actions to reach them. Make sure you're taking into account your well-being into these goals
                  because you'll only reach them if you're fully energized and motivated. (see goal #1)</p>

                <h4> Celebrate the small wins! </h4>
                <p> The fact that you decided to join Skillcrush should be enough reason to celebrate. Every step you take is one closer to getting your dream job and finding
                  a balanced lifestyle. From completing the practice exercises to coding your first website, everything is worthy of celebrating! </p>
