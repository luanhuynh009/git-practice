                <h4>Persistence and consistency are very important.</h4>
                <p>Being persistent means to keep going no matter what. When you are confused about something,
                  takes the steps to keep going, such as asking a question in the Slack channel or writing an email.
                  It's definitely okay to get stuck or make a mistake, but don't let those stop you from moving.
                  If you give up at the first sign of difficulty, you will not grow past where you are,
                  thus inhibiting you from your bigger goals!</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help.</h4>
                <p>The entire Skillcrush community as well as Google is here for you. Ask a question in the Slack channel
                  or send an email to the Skillcrush team as they suggest. You are responsible for your own
                  growth and development, so be sure to say something when you are stuck and people will work with you
                  to help fix it!
