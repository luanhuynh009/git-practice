                <h4>Be Resilient!!!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Remember...</p>
                <p><strong>''There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.''</strong></p>
