            <h1>Hi friends! I'm Maddie.<br>
                Here's some advice for your coding adventures!</h1>

                <h4>Only focus on you and your journey.</h4>

                <p>It can be tempting to compare yourself to others. If you google tech jobs 
                    such as front-end developers, it can seem overwhelming and like you'll 
                    never understand what everyone else knows. But truth is, there is just so much 
                    out there and <em>so many different ways to code</em>. Everyone is 
                    always going to know different things or do things differently.<br><br>

                    It's important that you <strong>only focus on you</strong> and your journey. This will help 
                    the anxiety or fear you may have. As long as you are passing and understanding the 
                    Skillcrush material, you WILL get there and become a pro in no time!
                </p>

                <h4>YOU can do this!</h4>

                <p>Imposter syndrome is super real when first starting out. I'm still trying 
                    to figure it out. Tech and coding is so different - you're pretty much learning 
                    a new language!<br><br>

                    It's like the foreign language class we were required to take in high school. I remember 
                    feeling strange and like I had no idea what was going on. It's all <em>completely natural</em> to 
                    feel this way even when learning a coding language.<br><br>

                    So try your best to remember your confidence and that you <em>belong</em> 
                    in tech. <strong>YOU can do this!</strong>
