                <h4>Don't doubt yourself</h4>
                <p>But take a reality check once in a while too. Sometimes, you need someone with more experience to give you their perspective.</p>
 
                <p>Take into account everything they've been through. Have they helped you before? Where have they succeeded? How can you test their ideas?</p>
 
                <h4>Becoming goal oriented</h4>
                <p>The best way to avoid disappointment is to know what you are working for. If we work for material things, our work will never be enough. Our focus should be for our children.</p>
 
                <p>We must take our gifts and passions and use them to help those we care about, and ultimately, further a goal greater than ourselves.</p>
 
                <p>Focus on something you know you're good at. It should be something the world needs and rewards you for. Be passionate about helping people.</p>
