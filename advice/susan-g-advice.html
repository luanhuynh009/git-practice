                <p>You will learn so much from troubleshooting and solving problems that arise. </p>

                

                <h4>Remember to ask for help!</h4>
                <p>Don't spend too much time troubleshooting an issue. Sometimes it's a typo that another person could spot right away rather than you spending hours on it and still not seeing it. Also, the validator is your friend.
