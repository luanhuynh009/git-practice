                <h4>Review the lessons again. And again, and again!</h4>
                <p>I wanted to get everything right the first time, and I wanted to see that green check at the end of each lesson upon completion! I was so confident until I got to the projects. I felt confused, scared and stressed.
                  This is not for me, I thought.</p>

                <p>Then I remembered a saying we have in Spanish..."es una carrera, no son carreritas" which translates to "it's a career, not a race"..which, actually does not work in english but, you get the idea.
                    Just reviewing the lessons and taking some notes was a complete changer for me. Writing just basic things down made them really stick and helped me remember everything better.</p>

                <h4>Take a break!</h4>
                <p>I was very keen on finishing the lessons before taking breaks, and realized sometimes I was making very silly mistakes. It's useful to go out, take a walk, have some tea, or come back tomorrow.
                  A clear mind and fresh eyes will help more than hours of staring at your computer and try to figure out where you went wrong.
