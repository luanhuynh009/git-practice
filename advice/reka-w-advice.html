                <h4>Confusion can be fun!</h4>
                <p>When you're starting out as a developer, all of the texts and coding can be confusing. The text editor looks funny with all of these strange abbreviations and symbols in different colors. But, all of these different elements are just pieces of the puzzle!</p>

                <p>As a developer, you are putting together the pieces to make a fun, attractive (and functioning) puzzle. When putting together a jigsaw puzzle as kids, we all start out with just a few pieces. We learn to look for the pieces that seem to fit on the edges or that make up the corners. Then, we learn to look for pieces that are the same color, and we group those together. We use the box-top as a guide to help us figure out where the pieces go. As we become more experienced, we graduate to puzzles that are more challenging. We move from 20-piece puzzles to 100 pieces. Then to 1,000 pieces.</p>

                <p>This is the same thing we do with coding!</p>

                <h4>Putting the pieces together.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning to code, you learn which pieces go on the outside edges, such as section headings and HTML tags. You learn to use certain tags to open or close a line. You learn to put other tags inside those opening and closing tags. Then, just like grouping puzzle pieces by color, you learn to group elements by paragraphs or into lists. You'll even group parts of your code in the header, body, or footer sections. All the while, you'll use your web browser and/or your design comp to help you put the pieces together - exactly how you used the box-top to put the jigsaw puzzle together! As you become more experienced, you can add more pieces.</p>
                <p>As a chid, I enjoyed putting puzzles together. It was such a challenge! But, the challenge is what made it fun! Today, I still get that feeling of being challenged and yet still having fun with web development. Sometimes I get frustrated when I can't figure something out. In those times, I take a break, walk away from the screen, and come back later with fresh eyes. Then, I notice things that I didn't see before. When I can find those mistakes and create solutions, I feel like I've completed a part of the puzzle! Woo-hoo!</p>
