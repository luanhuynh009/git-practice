                <h4>Challenges are opportunities, not problems!</h4>
                <p>Remember, you are literally learning a new language! There are going to many times when you come across a challenge that absolutely baffles you, but usually, that is the exact opportunity for breakthrough that you needed. When you get temporarily stuck, it helps you to ask the questions that will bring you to the next level as a coder. Don't worry, you totally got this!!</p>
 
 
                <h4>Take the time to understand the hows and the whys.</h4>
                <p>It's OKAY to take however much time you need to truly understand what you are learning. This is not a test that you quickly memorize the night before and then forget shortly after. Be kind to yourself! Do whatever is best for you to be able to comprehend all this new information, even if it takes a little more time. </p>
