                <h4>Mistakes Were Made!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning new skills in tech, such as how to code HTML5 and how to use CSS, you need to
                be mindful that everyone makes mistakes and that is part of the learning process. Mistakes and problem
                solving go hand in hand. Additionally, tell yourself to trust the process. Every software engineer and
                developer started where you are right now.
              </p>

                <p>Giving yourself grace while learning new skills can be hard to do in a society where comparison is King.
                Every engineer and developer, website maker, App creator, and desiner is different and unique. You're goal
                is not to be just like someone else, but to be YOU and bring what only you can bring to the industry!</p>

                <h4>Commit to Lifelong Learning</h4>
                <p> So now you know the basics of coding and building a static page! Awesome! Now what? Stay committed to
                  learning as much as you can, whether that is a whole new skill like adding Git and GitHub to your toolbelt
                  or simply honing those HTML5 skills. Tech is always evevolving and improving. You need to as well!
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>Anytime we apply ourselves to learn ANYTHING we don't already know there will be an uncomfortable
                and uneasy feeling as we put forth the effort to GROW. We must become comfortable being uncomfortable.
                The result however, is that we now have new skills! We are not the same as we were yesterday and isn't that
                wonderful!</p>
