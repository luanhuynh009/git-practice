                <h4>Practice Makes Perfect!</h4>
                <p>When you first start your journey into the tech world, it can feel super overwhelming and challenging.</p>
                
                <p>Some questions you may have asked yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How can I code a dope yet functional website from scratch?</li>
                        <li>Will I be really able to switch careers into tech?</li>
                        <li>What if it gets too difficult for me and I feel like giving up?</li>
                    </ul>
 
                <p>Remember, we all have to start somewhere. No one becomes a professional web developer or fabulous visual designer overnight. The hardest part is simply to start!</p>
                    
                <p>Make a schedule that works for you, learn one lesson at a time, and take the time to practice to find what works and what doesn't. Creating these small habits can end up being super rewarding in the end.</p>
 
                <h4>Take Advantage of the Awesome Skillcrush Community.</h4>
                <p>One thing I love about Skillcrush is that there is no such thing as a dumb question. So don't hesitate to reach out to your instructors or other fellow Skillcrushers on Slack and ask away whenever you're feeling stuck.</p>
 
                <p>Everyone is super supportive and learns from one another. It might just be my favorite part of joining Skillcrush.</p>
