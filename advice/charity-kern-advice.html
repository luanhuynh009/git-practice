                    <h4>Ahhh! Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When I began my website programming journey, I was doing something that I'd never done before. It was a new challenge, a new opportunity, and something that frankly scared me just a bit. In fact, Iâ€™d never even considered this path until a few months before. So I get it. What do these new words and signs mean? I am sooo confused!</p>
 
                    <p>But hey! We are heading in the right direction. Confusion is a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                    <h4>Determination and Desire play a huge role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. Keep at it! Try a different route. Search and ask for help.</p>
 
                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. So work it!</p>
