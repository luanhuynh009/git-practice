                <h4>Getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable</h4>
                <p>When I started learning how to code, I was in unfamiliar territory. I'm used to knowing what I'm doing, and feeling assured in my experience.
                  Learning a new, multi-faceted, complex skillset left me feeling insecure and riddled with self-doubt.</p>

                <p>So I fell back on practices that have worked for me before:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Remind myself every day that it's ok not to know. That's why I'm learning.</li>
                    <li>Take notes, go over the notes, look stuff up, ask instructors, ask other students, watch the YouTube. There's no right way to learn.</li>
                    <li>Tear it down and build it again. If it's not working, delete it all and start over. This is experiential learning and that's the way it works!</li>
                    <li><em>Trust the Process.</em> I will go days trying to work something out, waiting for it to come clear. Clarity comes. In it's own time, often, but it does show up.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>
                    I didn't write that, but it's incredibly TRUE. The concepts come clear way after you learn the mechanics.
                </p>

                <h4>It's all about exposure</h4>
                <p>Learning new interfaces, tools, command lines, languages.. this is as much about how it all works together as it is memorizing programming languages.
                This is a solar system of planets orbiting each other, and every time you take off in your rocket, you make more connections as to how it all works. It takes a minute. That's ok.</p>
