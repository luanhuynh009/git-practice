                <h4>Take it one step at a time</h4>
                <p class="wisdom">Learning a brand new task can be quite overwhelming.  When you feel overwhelmed, take a step back (and
                  a deep breath) and take the task one step at a time!</p>


                <h4>Work on little bits at a time</h4>
                <p class="wisdom">If working full time while taking this class, allow yourself to only work on little bits at a time.
                  Don't feel discouraged if you are only able to put in one hour a day.  Every little bit adds up! Take
                  detailed notes and refresh your memory regularly throughout the class by glancing over your notes from
                  the previous day before starting a new section.
                </p>

                <h4>And finally, just remember...</h4>
