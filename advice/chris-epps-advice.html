                <h4>Determine which learning method works best for you, then immerse yourself!</h4>
                <p>I learn best with the hands-on approach, or kinesthetic style. The others are visual, auditory, and reading/writing. For coding, it's really helpful to go over things repeatedly, so it gets more comfortable to scan through larger amounts of it later.</p>

                <h4>Stay focused, and avoid shiny objects!</h4>
                <p>There are so many resources available that show ways to customize a webpage via code, and it's overwhelming trying to absorb it all. Just remember to stay on track with what it is that you're working towards, and keep drilling! HTML, CSS, Javascript, whatever it is, don't get distracted by other language/script/programming types that cause you to backtrack and try them all. Sure a Jack of all Trades is convenient starting out, but you'll want to master some of these trades the more you dive in.
                </p>

                <h4>Practice, practice....and practice some more!</h4>
                <p>Pracice makes Permanent. You create your habits, then your habits create you. So make these habits the type that give you an eye for detail. A knack for writing clean and organized code. Good habits, that don't create more work for others, will show others that you're good at what you do.  </p>
