            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Be Patient.</h4>
                <p>That moment that panic hits, remind yourself that everything is fine. The sun and earth are still doing what we expect them to do, and you, learning code, are getting confused, just as you might expect.</p>

                <p>Breathe and talk to yourself. Yes. Talk to yourself outloud and say...</p>

                <h4>It's ok not to know this right now. Take your time!</h4>
                <p>And know that if, with patience the answers don't come, you can head over to the message boards on Slack and get some advice!
                </p>

                <p>Also, take care of yourself.</p>

                <p>Get up at least every 45 minutes and drink water! Having to pee will also inspire you get up.</p>
