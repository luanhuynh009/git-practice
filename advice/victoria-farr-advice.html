                <h4>Lessons in productivity I learned during a pandemic.</h4>
                <p>Hello, Friend! üëã<p>
                  <p>I'm not sure what your particular life situation is-but mine's full of a lot of tasks: from taking care of my little one, my day job, and life stuff a.k.a. laundry, laundry, and more laundry. (It never ends! üòÇ) When the pandemic of 2020 arrived on our shores in the U.S., my life was suddenly flipped upside down! I found myself in a situation where I was expected to produce more (working from home whilst assisting my child with his virtual school set-up) with <em>less</em> support, suprisingly...and I consider myself to be very fortunate-I'm grateful for what I did have...but seriously, I don't have to tell <em>you</em> what a shit show 2020 was. You lived it, too!</p>

                  <p>The <strong>best</strong> things I learned last year were a particular constellation of productivity methodologies that helped me organize and prioritize the dumpster fire that my life unexpectedly became seemingly overnight. I had to completely re-think my approach to juggling multiple tasks, so I began researching solutions and strategies online. Here are some of the best resources and tools I found worked well! They can be a valuable addition to your metaphorical toolbox, even as things slowly get back to "normal."</p>

                  <h4>Time Management</h4>

                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro Technique.</a> One the absolutely best tools I discovered for battling the feelings of overwhelm and the highly understandable impulse to stress-eat and binge Netflix for 8 hours a day. </p>
                  <p>It's a very simple idea-you use a timer to break down work into chunks, usually about 25 minutes long with a 5-minute break at the end of each "Pomodoro." You can use anything you want to time yourself-an egg timer, the timer function on your smartphone, or try one of the many free apps. Give it a try-it really helps! You can do <em>anything</em> for 25 minutes, really!</p>
                  <p>Other related time-management ideas you might want to check out: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">Timeboxing</a> or <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-use-time-blocking-to-manage-your-day-4797509">Time Blocking </a>(a.k.a. 'monotasking' or 'time chunking')</p>

                <h4>Bullet Journaling</h4>
                <p>The <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a> methodology wasn't entirely new to me, but approaching it with new eyes and purpose gave me the incentive to really implement it fully in a way I hadn't, previously. While I don't use a physical notebook as recommended, I do use the ideas! (It's great to begin using the Bujo method on paper, first, though-to get the hang of it!)</p>

                <p>For daily task tracking and organizing, the tools I use right now are primarily <a href="https://todoist.com/overview"> Todoist</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/personal">Notion.</a> (Both these companies have <em>excellent</em> blogs full of extra resources and ideas, by the way!)</p>
