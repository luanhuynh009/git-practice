            <h1>Hi, my name is Catarina and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
                <p>Well duh, I know that. <br> 
                    <br>
                    I remember when I looked at my first line of code and thought, "Wth is does all this mean?"
                    "How am I ever going to make this a legit career for myself?" What I quickly
                    learned was that with coding, everything starts to sink in with <em>practice</em>. So take the time to
                    do the bonus work, the extra work, to make sure you're comfortable with all the new skills and knowledge
                    you're aquiring.
                </p>
                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask (or look) for help</h4>
                <p>"There's no possible way you're going to remember all these lines of codes and commands." <br>
                    <br>
                    These were the words my IT husband so gently said to me one night as I threaten to pull out my hair in 
                    frustration. All I had wanted to do was code an entire landing page (my first, mind you) by memory (palm 
                    to the face). He assured that even in his seasoned IT career, there were plently of times where he needed to 
                    research, look up, and even reach out for help. <br>
                    <br>
                    Don't feel like you need to perfect the code. There's a reason 
                    why cheat sheets exist, use them! And if your spouse is in IT, put them on retainer!
                </p>
                <h4>Enjoy the learning process</h4>
                <p>There aren't many times during our adulthood that we can sit down and actually learn something new or build a new
                    skill. So, if you've given yourself this opportunity, make sure you're enjoying it and that you're gaining all you need 
                    from it!
