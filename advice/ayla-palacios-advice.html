            <h1>Hey, hi. I'm Ayla. Here's my advice to you as you learn to code:</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <div class="practice">
                    <h4>Just keep practicing.</h4>
                    <p>Continuously utilizing your newly learned skills is so important.
                      I've found there is a bit of a use it or lose it thing going on here.
                      If you don't keep practicing everything you've learned, it just
                      kind of disappears. </p>
                    </div>
                <div class="patience">
                    <h4>Be patient.</h4>
                    <p>Don't expect to know how to do everything you want to do all
                      at once. These things take time. Even if you're spending hours
                      and hours working with this information every day, it's really
                      going to take continued use and pracice to get yourself comfortable.<br>
                      So, keep practicing ;)
