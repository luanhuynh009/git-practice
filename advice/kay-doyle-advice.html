                <h4>Consistency is Key!</h4>
                <p>When you're first starting anything (Skillcrush, coding, riding a bike) it can feel strange and challenging. I think the worst thing you can do for yourself in this time is to give up. Just because something is new and challenging, doesn't mean it isn't worth it. Even when you don't feel like practicing code, practice. Consistency is key, discipline is key; they will outlast motivation and keep you on track when you feel like quitting. New things can be difficult, but  they're worth the dedication. </p>
