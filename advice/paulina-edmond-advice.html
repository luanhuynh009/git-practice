                <h4>Take the leap!</h4>
                <p>When you begin coding, there can be a lot of confusion that may make you question whether you are making the right choice. This confusion then turns to hesitance as you are working on different projects. You may feel like giving up when things aren't working as planned.</p>

                <p>No matter what happens, just remember you <strong>have</strong> made the right decision! All of your projects may not come out perfectly the first time, but the more you practice, the better you'll get. You just have to take that first leap to get yourself there!</p>

                <p>Also remember, there is nothing wrong with asking for help! We are all learning, and it's good that everyone has a different perspective on problem solving. But without asking, there's a possibility that you won't ever gat an answer. So, use those resources as much as you can!</p>
