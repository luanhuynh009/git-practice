                <h4>Stay optimistic!</h4>
                <p>There are days when the topics will come easy for you and days when topics seem beyond your grasp.</p>

                <p>Optimism is your friend.  Remember to be optimistic and keep working at it.  You will get the subject. </p>

                <h4>Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement.  Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</h4>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
