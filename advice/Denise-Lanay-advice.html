                <h3>There is light at the end of the tunnel</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite movie quotes is "Everything will be alright in the end. So, if it isn't alright, it is not yet the end". Trust me, the same can be said for your new journey into coding.</p>

                <p>At first, things may seem a bit confusing and that's okay. Remember that you are learning a new language and a new way of "speaking" that is probably different than anything you've ever learned before. Be compassionate and patient with yourself. </p>


                <h3>Take a walk (or a nap)</h3>
                <p>It can be counterintuitive to step away from a problem when you're in the midst of trying to solve it but I can't recommend it enough. If you're stuck, take a walk or, even better, a nap!</p>

                <p>Some of the most brilliant minds of our times cite these techniques as critical to their creative process. Removing yourself from the problem alleviates the pressure on your conscious mind to perform and gives your subconscious mind breathing room to solve the problem often  ending up in "Eureka!" moments that will have you running back to the computer to input the problem-solving code.</p>
