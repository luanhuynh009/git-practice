                  <h4>You Got This!</h4>
                  <p>You took the <span>leap</span> to try something new. It's a new <span>challenge</span>, a new <span>opportunity</span>, and you have to <span>have faith</span> in your self and your new skills.</p>

                  <p>Don't be afraid to <span>make mistakes</span>.  We cannot become experts unless we are willing to fail, <span>get up</span> and <span>try again</span>, and again, and again and again.</p>

                  <h4>You are the keeper of your path.</h4>
                  <p> Lay the groundwork for your future and <span>be proud</span> to invest in yourself. </p>

                  <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>

                  <p> Sometimes you learn better when you can do the work yourself.  Other times, you should <span>stop being so stubburn</span> and just ask for help! <br> <span>Hard work</span> doesn't always mean difficult work, sometimes it means <span>smart work.</span> </p>
