                <h4>There's no reason to re-invent the wheel!</h4>
                <p>While programming may be new to you, most of us have spent a great deal of time browsing the web.
                  And the web is vast and full of good examples, ripe for the picking!</p>

                <p>When you see a web site or app that is particularly appealing to you, look at the source code!
                  While you might not immediately understand all of the coding, you can use what you already know to identify
                  elements that you can emulate going forward.</p>

                <h4>Collaboration is key</h4>
                <p>When you're a newbie at coding, take advantage of the interconnectedness of the web and the knowledge &amp;
                  experience of programmers who have come before you.</p>

                <p>The web is awash with blogs and repositories offering tools and advice for your learning journey. And
                  there are numerous ways of connecting with online communities of developers, from GitHub to Slack.
                  Ask questions, make comments, and flex your programming muscle by adding to a repo, right from the get-go!</p>
