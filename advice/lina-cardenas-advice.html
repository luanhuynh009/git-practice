            <h1>Hi, my name is Lina and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>The <strong><em>Why</em></strong> will keep you going!</h4>
                <p>Write down your <strong>why</strong>. Be clear with yourself why are you learning to code or learning this new programming language or why do you want to change your career into tech.</p>
                <p>There will be times when things get confusing, or we just stagnate or we feel frustrated. In these days you will be tempted to quit, but don't, reach out to your written <strong>why</strong>, remember why are you in this quest, take some distance from your work and you will be recharged to continue =)!</p>

                <h4>Different paces</h4>
                <p>You might be a natural when learning HTML but feel like moving in snail speed with CSS.</p>
                <p>Be humble and proud, for both accepting that somethings will be easier for you but others will challenge you more. Embrace it and no speed is better than the other. Just make sure you learn.</p>

                <h4>Reach out!</h4>
                <p>Do your homework, try to solve your problems, but if you are in a dead end, don't feel alone and reach out for help. You would be surprise of how many developers are willing to help you in your journey.</p>

                <h4>Final thought</h4>
                <p>A tree was once a seed, so nurture your knowledge, practice and bare in mind that you need some time to see the seed start to become a tree.</p>
