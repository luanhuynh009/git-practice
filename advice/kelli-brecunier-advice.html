                <h2>Don't Panic! It's OK to be a beginner.</h2>
                <p>I allowed my eagerness and excitement to learn to sabotage my progress. To the new learner, I would definitely stress taking time to learn the basics. Like REALLY learn the basics.  I was in such a rush to start seeing results that I didnâ€™t take enough time to play with an element before I started trying to use it.  After first being introduced to a html or css concept I would immediately break away and attempt to use the element in the most complex way possible. Due to this I ran into A LOT of issues and frustrations that might have been easily avoided had I just taken the time to get a firm grasp on the fundamentals.</p>
                <p>Until I realized this I tended to hop from freecodecamp to youtube video attempting to mash code together. As a result my code was looking pretty Frankenstien and often ended up very broken. (Yeah yeah, I know Frankenstien was the man not the monster. Just let me have this.) </p>
