                <h4>Make it happen</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Even though everything is challenging for you right now, be sure you can do this. Just take your time and be patient.</p>

                <h4>Practice every day</h4>
                <p>While you're learning this new stuff practice what you've learned in order to stick with it.
                </p>

                <p>Also, I would like to highlight that you should make a habit. That means to block out a specific time when you know you're productive and practice every day.</p>

                <p>Having a growth mindset will help you to overcome your uncertainty. You've got this!</p>
