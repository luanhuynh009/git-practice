                <h4>Time is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Timing is everything! What you do with that time is up to you. If you see time as an enemy you will be in a contest battle against it.</p>

                <p>Like any relationship, what you put in is what you get out and perfection isnâ€™t key as long as you learn.</p>

                <h4>Take it one thing at a time.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning anything new, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or how to dance, you go through this uncomfortable phase.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the programming learning process, and in fact, it's a critical part of any learning process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                <p>Just like you learn a dance move one step at a time and practice the steps you don't know till you get it right!</p>
