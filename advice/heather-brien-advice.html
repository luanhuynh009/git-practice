                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>It can feel really daunting to learn all these new languages and skills at once.
                  But the feeling of pride when you get when you solve a problem is totally worth it. </p>

                <p>It might seem like you can never be a pro in such a complex industry,
                  but remember you only have to take it one step at a time and mastery
                   does not have to come all at once.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>Making mistakes and having things go wrong help that rule stick in your brain so you remember it the next time you work on a similar task.</p>
