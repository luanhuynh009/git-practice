                <h4>Tired or Lazy?</h4>
                <p>Don't let laziness defeat you. If you are tired or stuck, have a break instead of pushing yourself harder. After a break you will be surprised how quickly and easy you can solve any problem or understand anything. Trust me, I have been there :) Don't run from your problems, face them instead and soon they will not be problems anymore. A refreshed mind and body can achieve a lot more :)))</p>

                <h5>I would like to share this article from "Study Buddhism by Berzin Archives."</h5>

                <p>"One might wonder how we can distinguish between tiredness and laziness. Firstly, there are different types of laziness, like when we get distracted by trivial things. We’re too lazy to do our meditation or studies or whatever, and instead get distracted by a television program or surfing the Internet. Then there’s the laziness of putting things off until later, where you’re always thinking you can postpone things. Then there’s also a type of laziness where you make excuses, like “I simply can’t do it.” </p>

                <p>When we’re tired, we still have the desire to take the action: “I really want to do it, but I’m very sleepy now, so I’ll take a short rest and then I fully intend to go back to it.” This isn’t making excuses or not caring. Laziness doesn’t have this wish to really want to continue."
                </p>

                <p>If it was just laziness we would give up on our goal. There is a difference between laziness and just "needing a break." </p>
