                <h4>A Brave New World</h4>
                <p>Journeying into a brand new world you know nothing about is scary! You're completely unaware of your surroundings
                and you might not know which way to turn. Coding can be extremely overwhelming when trying to read it! Thankfully, great resources (like Skillcrush) exist where you don't have to
                feel so lost! And you know what? You decided to take that first step into the unknown. Most of the time, that is the most difficult part of the journey! With practice and hard work, things won't seem so bad anymore.
                You'll look back and think <em>"wow, I can't believe I thought that was difficult before!"</em></p>

                <h4>The Journey of 1,000 Miles...</h4>
                <p>So now that you've taken the first step, it is important to keep going. I know, sometimes life gets in the way. Whether it be
                   routine things we need to get done or whether the tides in our life get rough, we need to carry on. Consider this: we have
                   24 hours in the day and normally 1/3 of that is spent sleeping. The other third of that is probably spent at work if you have a full-time
                   job. If you can find any free time at all (preferably at least one hour a day) to spend coding, that time adds up! You'll move through
                   the material faster than you imagined! Just like you should carve out time to exercise your body, you need to do the same with your mind!
                </p>

                <h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>

                <p>If you're able to commit a few hours each day to coding, then great! Regardless, if you are working hard, there's no doubt you'll encounter
                some bumps in the road with concepts you aren't understanding. You might feel you are taking too long to grasp the idea. Sometimes, you do have
                to take a mental break! Time away from the computer and other electronics like your phone and the TV are good for your mind and your eyes!
                Perhaps you can break up the time with a hobby of yours, such as cooking or arts and crafts, just to relax. Then, don't lose your focus; dive right back in!</p>
