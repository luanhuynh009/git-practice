                <h4>Trust yourself, you got this!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning a new language it takes time for our brains to absorb all the information, but as we continue the learning curve something magical happens where it all clicks, and then we start to get all the tech jokes and puns too, LOL.</p>
 
                <p>Make Google your best friend and Bookmark all the free resources like: w3schools, Mozilla Developer website, etc. And if you ever need help, reach out your Slack network!</p>
 
                <h4>We're all in the SAME BOAT!</h4>
                <p>I keep hearing that coding is a skillset that is forever evolving that even pro's don't know it all, so give the impostor syndrome a kick in the butt!!!</p>
 
                <p>Visualize your end goal, how are you feeling? (happy I hope)... so keep that thought to push yourself thru, and every now and then DO A HAPPY DANCE!!!!!!!</p>
