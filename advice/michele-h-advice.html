                <h4>Practice Makes Perfect</h4>
                <p>When things seem overwhelming (because they <strong>will!</strong>), just keep going.  Keep practicing, keep trying new things, and eventually it will start to make sense.</p>
 
                <p>There will be times when you don't want to do it, but those are the times when habits are truly made.</p>
 
                <h4>Try Things You Don't Think You Can Do</h4>
                <p>We grow by attempting things that are outside of our comfort zones.  Even though it might be scary, when we hit that wall is when we stretch and grow our skills by leaps and bounds.</p>
 
                <p>Everything seems overwhelming when we are first starting out, but eventually you will look back on your beginnings with wonder at how much you have learned and how far you have come.</p>
