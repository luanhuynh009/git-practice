                <h4>Be prepared for frustration!</h4>
                <p>There will be a point when you hit a wall and feel like this. </p>

                <p>Ignore it and keep working. Ask questions. Google search. Use Slack. Be persistent, curious, and determined. </p>
<p> You are not that, you are this.

<b> <p>  Even when you forget or ignore it.</p>
                <h4>Use other resources</h4>
                <p>If you're not connecting the dots or getting the practice you need for the info to stick, try free coding courses elsewhere. </p>
                <p>Sometimes learning with another teacher or viewpoint can change how you put 2 + 2 together.</p>

                <h4>Take a break</h4>
                <p> Step away and do something else for a few days. Try a favorite hobby! <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Bob_at_Easel.jpg" alt="Bob Ross painting"> </p>
              <b> <p>Coding can be like trying to remember a forgotten piece of info, only to remember it hours later.
                It's good to re-charge and get a little perspective.</p>

                <p> When all else fails, cats!</p>
