                    <h4>Remember Your Why</h4>
                    <p>Superhero bootcamp is exhausting [cue your favorite superhero theme song]! Remembering why you started &mdash; to save the world, to do what you love, to provide a comfortable life for your family &mdash; can refuel you when you feel like giving up. In case you forgot, you are doing great!</p>

                <div class="advice-point">
                    <h4>Bring Your Whole Self to Work</h4>
                    <p>Rather than plodding through each module like a monotonous Monday, put your personal spin on the activities throughout the lesson. Find ways to relate the examples to your own life, and come up with ways you would improve your life (or someone else's) using the new skill you learned!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advice-point">
                    <h4>Health is Wealth</h4>
                    <p>Learning a new skill takes focus, patience and a bit of creativity. If your body is not up to the task, you can experience mental fatigue and burnout more quickly. Eating a healthy diet, resting, and scheduling breaks for fun/rest will bring you back to programming energized and more effective.</p>
