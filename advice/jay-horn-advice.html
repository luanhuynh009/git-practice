                <h3>Never Give Up!</h3>
                <p>If you are confused then that means you are exploring an area of knowledge yet to be put together like a puzzle.
                    The brain will make excuses to stop doing the work to better your future because it wants the short term feel
                    good vibes. The brain has been made to help your survive and change is a scary thing so when something new arrives 
                    it will do what it can to distract and to convince you that there is no need to learn new material. So for the sake of your future self
                    while the mind may make sweet whispers in your ear to watch Netflix or check your social media, remember that you are changing your
                    future for the better.
