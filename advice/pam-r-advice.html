            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <p>That all said, I find it is best in the beginning if you don't take yourself too seriously. If you put
                yourself on a tight timeline, or worst yet - compare and contrast to others that are just starting out
                as well, you are setting yourself up for stress and disapppointment. Try not to judge, and remember that
                set-backs are all part of the process.</p>

            <p>Most important of all it to have fun! Coding can provide a deep sense of achievement. Celebrate the
                little wins; do a dance; high five your dog; eat some chocolate. Remember - coders are life long
                learners. You are just starting a long but statisfying journey! Enjoy!!</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Be good to yourself</h4>
            <p>Focus can often be key, but with it can come tight shoulders, hunched posture and strained eyes. Be aware
                of your body and take breaks as needed. Look away from your screen every 15 minutes or so or just close
                your eyes. </p>

            <p>Create a healthy work space. A good office chair is a worthwhile investment. If possible, surround your
                space with your favorite colors and inspiring images to give yourself a boost. Your lighting is equally
                important. If you are working during the day, place your desk near natural light if you can. A warm
                white bulb will help with eye strain. </p>

            <p>Learning something new, and it just isn't falling into place? Take a break. Get out in nature (or
                whatever recharges your batteries), have lunch with a friend, watch an episode of Modern Family (just
                don't binge-watch), go play with your dog, or take a nap. You will be returning with a fresh perspective
                and odds are, it will all start to click. </p>

            <p>My motto for 2021 is Empowerment through Doing. So, as Nike says, Just do it! </p>
