                <h4> Don't be too hard on yourself!</h4>

                <p> Try not to be too hard on yourself if you're having trouble understanding or applying a certain concept or skill.</p>

                <p> Everyone learns at their own pace and learning something like coding can be confusing if you've never worked with it before.</p>

                <h4> Consistency and Repetition</h4>

                <p> Being consistent with your lessons can be tough, especailly if you have other responisibilities such as a family or full-time job. </p>

                <p> You must push through those tough times and stay consistent, doing so will help build your understanding of various concepts through repetition.</p>
