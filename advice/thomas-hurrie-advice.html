            <h1>Hi, my name is Thomas <br>and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Keep on keeping on</h4>
                <p>The best piece of advice I can give is to adopt a growth mindset. Everyday try to learn something new. 
                    No one is born a gifted coder, athlete, musician, etc. It takes practice and determination. The more you 
                    do the better you will get. Keep plugging away and you will see returns, I guarantee it!
                </p>

                <p>I attempted coding twice before but was sidetracked by life and other commitments. However, it is never too 
                    late to start again and continue the journey. I am finally finishing my bachelor's degree at the age of 40. 
                    I never though it would take me over 20 years but everyone's path is different. I have learned a lot along the 
                    way and would not trade my experience, plus I now have a much greater appreciation for education.
                </p>

                <h4>All knowledge is gained through trial and error</h4>
                <p>You are going to make a lot of mistakes throughout this process and that is okay. The only way to really learn 
                    something is to gain some first hand experience. If you are not making mistakes, then you will not understand how 
                    to fix things when they inevitably break down the line.
                </p>

                <p>So roll up your sleeves, pour a tall glass of coffee or tea, and start coding, breaking things, and building them back again. 
                    To me it is one of the best parts about this field. You are encouraged to learn, tinker, and explore in ways that other 
                    careers don't afford you the time and encouragement to pursue. 
                </p>
