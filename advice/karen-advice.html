                <h4>Suspend your need to understand everything immediately.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. (I personally have an especially hard time with this phase, because I have a strong natural instinct to understand everything from the bottom up. But it doesn't always help.) Most of the time, the best path forward is to keep working with the new language or framework and iteratively come to understand its inner workings!</p>
 
                <h4>Ignore Imposter Syndrome.</h4>
                <p>You know it well. Imposter Syndrome is your old arch-nemesis, waiting to strike yet again when you stretch yourself beyond your previous limits. But it's a liar. You can do this, and you can become damn good at it. Keep pushing through those discouraging days and you'll <em>really become</em> the expert that you currently feel like you're only pretending to be.</P>
