                <h2>Be kind to yourself!</h2>
                <p>You will need a lot of patience with yourself. There's a lot of different things involved in the learning process.
                    Sometimes it will feel like you are falling behind, or not intelligent enough, or that you should be able to do something
                    specific that you want to do by now.</p>
        
                <p>At those moments you will need to be your best friend. Talk to yourself like you would talk to your best friend if they were going
                    through the same thing. Be kind, encouraging, take yourself for a walk or eat some cake.</p>
                <h2 class="middle-h2">Don't give up!</h2>
                <p>But take breaks when you need them. Sometimes all you need to solve a problem is some distance and some time. Do something different.
                    Learn something related. Think that this is not going to be always like that, but it will also not the only time you want to give up.
                </p>

                <h2>Explain it to your cat!</h2>
                <p>If you want to understand a concept, explain it to your cat. Teach them all the basics they need to understand the subject in question.
                    <br><br>Give them detailed examples, usage, edge cases. Tell them all the whats, hows and whys. They will blink slowly when they understand,
                    and you will learn and retain the concept.
