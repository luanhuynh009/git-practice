                <h4>One Day or Day One?</h4>
                <p>My biggest mistake was putting off learning to code.</p>
                
                <p>Start today!</p>
 
                <p>Do as much as you can when you can, and be consistent.</p><br>
 
                <h4>Don't Quit!</h4>
                <p>It can be overwhelming, exhausting and frankly uncomfortable when you're learning something new.</p>

                <p>It can feel like you'll never know enough to make your dreams come true</p>
 
                <p>One thing's for sure; you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</p>

                <p>When you feel overwhelmed, take a break but come back to it tomorrow.</p>
 
                <p>Keep coming back and you'll find yourself doing things you never imagined possible.</p>
